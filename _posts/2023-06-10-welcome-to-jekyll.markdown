My name is Jake Panikulam. I work at Main Street Autonomy, a company that builds software for getting the most out of your robot's sensors.

We provide two core products:

1. Pose engine: Build a map using only the sensors on your robot, then reliably localize using even fewer sensors.
2. Calibrate-Anywhere: Create instrinsic & extrinsic calibration for cameras, lidar, GPS, INS, IMU, wheel encoders and more using only general log data. No fiducials, no special markers, no human clicking.
